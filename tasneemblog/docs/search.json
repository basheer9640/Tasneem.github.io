    "text": "Afghani chicken kebab\nThe chicken will be really soft and tender, full of flavour but without the overpowering heat that Indians might expect. Traditionally cooked in a tandoor oven, this dish soon became really popular on my dinner menu. We Indians have a lot to thank the Afghan people for, with the tandoor being top of my list.\nIngredients 1 kg boneless chicekn thighs, cut in half\n2 1/2 tbsp ginger and garlic paste\n1 1/2 tsp salt\n1/2 tsp white pepper powder\n1 tsp cumin powder\n1 tsp coriander powder\njuice of 1 lime\n100 ml double cream\nDirections\n1 Add the ginger, garlic paste, white pepper powder, cumin powder, coriander, salt and lime juice in a bowl and mix well.\n2 Add the chicken and mix well. Marinate the chicken in the fridge for 4-24 hours.\n3 Add the cream after the chicken has marinated. Mix it well and skewer the chicken onto bamboo sticks.\n4 Preheat your grill to the highest setting and cook the chicken for 25 minutes, rotating it every 2-3 minutes."
