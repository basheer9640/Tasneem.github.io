Afghani chicken kebab

 The chicken will be really soft and tender, full of flavour but without the overpowering heat that Indians might expect. Traditionally cooked in a tandoor oven, this dish soon became really popular on my dinner menu. We Indians have a lot to thank the Afghan people for, with the tandoor being top of my list.

 Ingredients
1 kg boneless chicekn thighs, cut in half

2 1/2 tbsp ginger and garlic paste

1 1/2 tsp salt

1/2 tsp white pepper powder

1 tsp cumin powder

1 tsp coriander powder

juice of 1 lime

100 ml double cream



Directions

1 Add the ginger, garlic paste, white pepper powder, cumin powder, coriander, salt and lime juice in a bowl and mix well.

2 Add the chicken and mix well. Marinate the chicken in the fridge for 4-24 hours.

3 Add the cream after the chicken has marinated. Mix it well and skewer the chicken onto bamboo sticks.

4 Preheat your grill to the highest setting and cook the chicken for 25 minutes, rotating it every 2-3 minutes.
